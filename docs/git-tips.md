# GIT tips

# Fetch a file from another branch to the current one

git checkout branch_name -- filename

# Unstage all changes but leave files in the working directory untouched

git reset HEAD

# Unstage a file

git reset HEAD <filename>

# Go back to last commit and remove all changes from working directory

git reset HEAD --hard

# Delete untracked files

git clean -f

# Compare two branches

git diff develop..master

# Compare two commits

git diff <sha>..<sha>

## Unstage file

```bash
git reset filename
```

## Unstage deleted file

```bash
git checkout HEAD filename
```

## Undo commit

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD\^
```

## Checkout remote branch

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout develop
```

## Go back to previous branch

```bash
git checkout -
```

## Create empty master branch

```bash
git branch -D master
git checkout --orphan master
```

## Tag the release

```bash
# optional: tag important things, such as releases
git tag 1.0.0-RC1
```

## Delete local tag

```bash
git tag -d v0.2.0
```

## Delete remote tag

```bash
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.2.0
```

## Amend last commit

If you want to change the message of the latest commit do

```bash
git commit --amend -m "New commit message"
```

## Revert specific file to previous version

If you want to revert a specific file to its previous version do

```bash
git checkout -- filename
```

## Undo all changes in branch

If you want to reset all non-committed changes do

```bash
git reset --hard
```

## Restore a file deleted in a previous commit

If you want to restore a file deleted in a previous commit do

```bash
git rev-list -n 1 HEAD -- <file_path>
git checkout <deleting_commit>^ -- <file_path>
```

## Remove a file from a commit that has not been pushed

If you want to remove a specific file from a commit that has not been pushed do

```bash
git reset HEAD filename
```

You can do it without the --, but if the filename looks like a branch or tag (or other revision identifier), it may get confused, so using -- is best.

## Checkout specific version of file

You can also check out a particular version of a file

```bash
git checkout v1.2.3 -- filename         # tag v1.2.3
git checkout stable -- filename         # stable branch
git checkout origin/master -- filename  # upstream master
git checkout HEAD -- filename           # the version from the most recent commit
git checkout HEAD^ -- filename          # the version before the most recent commit
```

## Remove a commit that has not been pushed

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD^
```

to reset to the previous commit before the current head; that way you don't have to be copying around commit IDs.

## Revert a commit

Identify the hash of the commit, using `git log`, then use `git revert <commit>` to create a new commit that removes these changes. In a way, `git revert` is the converse of `git cherry-pick` -- the latter applies the patch to a branch that's missing it, the former removes it from a branch that has it.

## Create a patch

```bash
git commit ...
git checkout <branch_to_apply_patch_to>
git format-patch <branch_to_compare_against> --stdout > fix_empty_poster.patch
git apply --stat fix_empty_poster.patch
git apply --check fix_empty_poster.patch
git am --signoff < fix_empty_poster.patch
```

or

```bash
git diff > fix_empty_poster.patch
git apply fix_empty_poster.patch
```

## Sync a fork

Add remote repository `upstream`.

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/trntv/yii2-starter-kit.git
```

Fetch latest commit from it

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

Merge these commits to your repository

```bash
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
```

**IMPORTANT: there might be a conflicts between `upstream` and your code. You should resolve merging conflicts on your own**

## Prune remote branches

```bash
git fetch --prune && git branch -r | awk '{print $1}' | egrep -v -f /dev/fd/0 <(git branch -vv | grep origin) | awk '{print $1}' | xargs git branch -d
```

## Submodules

If you want to use someone else's repo as a Git Submodule on GitHub do

```bash
git submodule add git://github.com/username/repo.git destination/folder
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

from the root of your project.

## Stash

```bash
git stash save
git stash save --include-untracked (-u)
git stash pop (git stash apply && git stash drop)
git stash apply (to re-use same stash later)
git stash list
git stash show
git stash apply
git stash branch testchanges
```

## Renaming branches

If you want to rename a branch while pointed to any branch, do :

```
git branch -m <oldname> <newname>
```

If you want to rename the current branch, you can do:

```
git branch -m <newname>
```

## git-extras

```bash
git setup (from git-extras)
git ignore .DS_Store
git summary
git effort --above 10
git undo
```
