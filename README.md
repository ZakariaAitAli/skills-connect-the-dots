## Welcome

Have you ever worked in a repository with a lot of history? Perhaps you've had to track down related issues and pull requests in the past, or you've had to find who committed a particular change. If you've ever found yourself in any of these situations, you'll know how important it is to navigate your workspace.

- **Who is this for**: Developers, GitHub users, users new to Git, students, managers, and teams.
- **What you'll learn**:
  - Find relevant issues and pull requests.
  - Search history to find context.
  - Make connections within GitHub to help others find things.
- **What you'll build**: Repository with existing commits, duplicated issues, and a content defect to be fixed.
- **Prerequisites**: Before you take this course, you may want to go through the [GitHub Quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart) introduction on GitHub Docs and [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) course on GitHub Skills.
- **How long**: This course takes less than 15 min to complete.

In this course, you will:

1. Resolve a duplicate issue.
2. Find a commit in history.
3. Fix a broken sidebar.

### How to start this course

<!-- For start course, run in JavaScript:
'https://github.com/new?' + new URLSearchParams({
  template_owner: 'skills',
  template_name: 'connect-the-dots',
  owner: '@me',
  name: 'skills-connect-the-dots',
  description: 'My clone repository',
  visibility: 'public',

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.
